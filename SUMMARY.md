The website is live, but the 3 team member images will show as broken/missing until you add them.

### Quick Instructions:

1. **Visit**: https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
2. **Refresh (F5)** until you find a face matching each description:
   - Sarah Chen: Professional Asian woman, 30-35 years
   - Alexander Kovač: Professional European man, 40-45 years  
   - Luca Martinelli: Professional Mediterranean man, 35-40 years

3. **Save each image** to:
   - `C:\Users\mario\aistartup\public\images\sarah-chen.jpg`
   - `C:\Users\mario\aistartup\public\images\alexander-kovac.jpg`
   - `C:\Users\mario\aistartup\public\images\luca-martinelli.jpg`

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
